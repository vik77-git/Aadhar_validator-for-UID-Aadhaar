# 🪪 Aadhaar Card Verification System (Flask)

This codebase is a **Flask-based web application** for validating Aadhaar cards using **YOLOv8 + Tesseract OCR**.  
It automatically detects Aadhaar number, name, date of birth, and photo, then performs validation checks like **Verhoeff algorithm** for Aadhaar number and DOB correctness.
